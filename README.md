# Forecasting Net Prophet Project
My notebook is available in the file forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb

## Overview

This project aims to analyze the financial and user data of [MercadoLibre](http://investor.mercadolibre.com/investor-relations), the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. The primary objective is to determine if predicting search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock. The analysis is divided into four main steps and an optional fifth step:

1. **Find Unusual Patterns in Hourly Google Search Traffic:** Analyzing Google search traffic data to identify any unusual patterns that might link to corporate financial events.
  
2. **Mine the Search Traffic Data for Seasonality:** Investigating the search traffic data to detect any seasonality or recurrent patterns.
  
3. **Relate the Search Traffic to Stock Price Patterns:** Correlating the search traffic with MercadoLibre's stock price patterns to ascertain if any relationship exists.
  
4. **Create a Time Series Model with Prophet:** Utilizing the Prophet library to build a time series model to forecast future stock prices.

5. **Forecast Revenue Using Time Series Models (Optional):** An optional step to forecast revenue based on the time series models.
